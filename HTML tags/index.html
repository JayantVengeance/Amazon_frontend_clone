        <h2>Early life and education</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><h3>Cruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York,[5] to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017).[6] His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky,[7] and had English, German, and Irish ancestry.[8][9] Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films.[10] Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as "a merchant of chaos",[11] a "bully", and a "coward" who beat his children. He elaborated, "[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'"[11]

            In total, Cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years.<br><br>[12] Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada; when his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa.[13] He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education.[13][14] He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under drama teacher George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival.[13] Drama organizer Val Wright was in the audience and later said that "the movement and improvisation were excellent ... a classic ensemble piece."[13] In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States.[13] In 1978, she married Jack South.[15] Cruise briefly took a Catholic Church scholarship and attended the St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio; he aspired to become a Franciscan priest before leaving after a year. Priests at the seminary have said Cruise chose to leave the school when his family relocated again; however, a former classmate said that they both asked to leave after getting caught taking liquor.[16][17]: 24–26  In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.[17]: 47  He went on to star in the school's production of Guys and Dolls.[18] In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.[19]
            
            Cruise's biological father died of cancer in 1984.[20]</h3></p>
